# CIS197Project

This app is a way to pay for food on campus (essentially a venmo for penn dining). 
One of the features are signup, login, logout pages with user authentication. 
This will allow people to have their own custom account that tells them how much money they 
have in their app at all times. Another feature is that they can add money to their account. 
Another feature is that there is a page with the list of dining options along with some information 
about each option such as hours of operation, type of cuisine, etc. The main feature is that each 
person can pay for their meal through the app by typing in the cost.
